<P><A NAME="useSHMO"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>How do I use SHMO?</FONT>
<P>The format and display of SHMO are compatible with usage in <i>Orbital
Interaction Theory of Organic Chemistry</i>. Orbitals are displayed as
filled and open coloured circles. Orbital energies are displayed relative
to <i>alpha</i> in units of |<i>beta</i>|. Orbital selection is by clicking
on the orbital energy display or step up/step down buttons. Heteroatoms,
X, are incorporated as <i>a</i>X = <i>alpha</i> + <i>h</i>X|<i>beta</i>|,
and <i>b</i>XY = <i>k</i>XY|<i>beta</i>|, where the default values of the
parameters, <i>h</i>X and <i>k</i>XY, are taken from the literature. Thus
for C, <i>h</i>C = 0.0 and <i>k</i>CC = -1.0. Atoms and bonds may be 
<b>Add</b>ed, <b>Erase</b>d, or their types <B>Change</B>d at any time by
simple mouse clicks. The number of electrons may be adjusted at any time and
the net charges and bond orders displayed. All aspects of the calculation are 
printable.

<P><A NAME="csSHMO"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>What does this applet do?</FONT>

<P>SHMO theory finds "energies" of a molecule and its
corresponding molecular orbitals (MO). Only organic, planar (2 dimensional)
molecules with delocalized electrons can work well with this theory. The
most commonly known delocalized carbon structure is benzene. It is a six
membered ring usually drawn with a circle inside the ring denoting that
it has delocalized electrons.

<P>To draw benzene click on "Add." Now you can click
on the main canvas to add atoms or drag the mouse from one atom to another
to create bonds. Click on "Minimize" to adjust the structure to what it
"normally" resembles. "Minimize" uses Newton's equation to find the angles
for the rings and adjusts chains to 120 degrees.

<P>Click on "Find Energies" to initialize the graph.
The graph shows bezene's energies. Click on the energies to view the MO's
for that particular energy level. "Find Energies" places the molecule into
a matrix representation and diagonalizes the matrix. The eigen values are
the "energies" and their corresponding eigen vectors are the MO's which
are displayed solid for positive and open ringed for negative.

<P>Essentially this is a fully interactive applet that
solves eigen systems and Newton's equation specfically for Simple Huckel
Molecular Orbital Theory.

<P><A NAME="crSHMO"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Is SHMO copyrighted?</FONT>

<p>SHMO is licenced under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
Licence</a>. SHMO is free to use and free to distribute, although we
recommend you access SHMO at its original site (<a
href="http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/shmo">http://www.chem.ucalgary.ca/shmo</a>)
to be sure that you are using the most recent version available. If
you are interested in the Java source code please email <a
href="mailto:rich@cannings.org">Rich Cannings</a>.

<br><br>
<P><A NAME="getSHMO"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>How can I get a copy?</FONT>
<p>Even though you already have a copy in your cache, having your
own copy is benefical. First you can resize the window to your preference
if you use Sun's "appletviewer." Second it runs faster. Third you don't have
to waste bandwidth on the internet.
<p>
If you wish to download a permanent copy get <a href="SHMo2.zip">SHMo2.zip</a>.
 It will unzip into a directory called SHMo2. Make sure your "unzipping" 
program supports long filenames or SHMO will not run. To run, open your JDK 
1.1 compatible web browser and open "SHMo2.html" or run Sun's "appletviewer" 
by typing "appletviewer SHMo2.html" in you SHMo2 directory.

<P><A NAME="bugSHMO"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>Who do I send bug reports to?</FONT>

<p>SHMO is still a new program and may contain some
bugs. If you find a bug restart and document the sequence of events that
led you to the bug. Email that information to Dr. Rauk (<A HREF="mailto:rauk@che
m.ucalgary.ca">rauk@chem.ucalgary.ca</A>)and to Rich Cannings (<A HREF="ma
ilto:rich@cannings.org">rich@cannings.org</A>).

<P><A NAME="javaSHMO"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>My web browser doesn't support Java 
1.1. What can I do?</FONT>

<p>Sun's HotJava Browser, Netscape Communicator 4.5 and Microsoft's Interent
Explorer 4.0 all support the Java 1.1 standard. We recommend you use
the latest version of either <a
href="http://www.netscape.com/computing/download/index.html?cp=hom08x4.1">Netscape
Communicator</a> (v4.75) or <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/download/ie55.htm">Internet
Explorer</a> (v5.5). Note that if you are a Macintosh user, all
versions of Netscape Communicator prior to 6.0 do not support Java
1.1. Mac users should first use Internet Explorer version 4.5 or later.

<p>Sun's HotJava was the first and is the most portable.
It runs on a variety of platforms including Windows95, Solaris, Linux,
and Macintosh. It is written in java so if you have the JDK1.1 for your
platform and you know how to hack shell scripts, you can run it. You can
obtain a copy of HotJava through javasoft at <A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/products/hotjava/index.html">http://www.javasoft.com/products/hotjava</A>.

<p>Netscape Communicator version 4.5 includes the JDK 1.1. It is available at <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape</A>. 

<p>Contrary to Sun's propaganda, Microsoft's Internet
Explorer version 4 supports the JDK1.1. You can get it almost anywhere.
I can only assume at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</A>too. I had no trouble running SHMO with the preview releases
of IE but I have had some reports that the graph doesn't appear completely
in the final release of IE 4.0. I'm working on the bug.

<p> Finally, if your computer doesn't support HotJava
and Communicator and IE are too buggy you can obtain Sun's JDK1.1 or JRE1.1
(Java Runtime Environment) for many operating systems at
<A HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/">http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/</A>.
JDK1.1 runs on Windows 3.1, Windows95, WindowsNT, Linux, Irix, HP-UX, Mac,
AIX, Amiga, UnixWare, HP 3000, OS/2, NetWare, SUNOS, Solaris and many many
more. Once you have installed the JDK1.1 download <a href="SHMo2.zip">SHMO.zip</a> 
and follow the instructions in question 4.
