SHMO -- Simple Huckel Molecular Orbital Theory Calculator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I see that you have already unzipped the README file 
successfully. The SHMo2.zip file should contain 3 files:

README     - what you are reading right now
SHMo2.jar  - the Java ARchive of SHMO
SHMo2.html - the html file to execute SHMO

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First install the Java Development Kit (JDK) properly on 
your system. The JDK is available freely through JavaSoft 
at http://www.javasoft.com . 

Next run "appletviewer" (comes with the JDK) in the 
directory including SHMo2.html and SHMo2.jar, with the
argument "SHMo2.html". to be exact excute 
"appletviewer SHMo2.html" in the directory including 
SHMo2.html and SHMo2.jar.
